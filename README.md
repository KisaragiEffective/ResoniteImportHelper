# Resonite Import Helper
Bake and Import.

## Requirement and recommended tools
* UniGLTF is required to run. Download it from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases).
* Git is required to install. Download it from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Following tools are optional. This tool can invoke their hooks.
* VRChat Avatar SDK ([Download](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/))
* Non-Destructive Modular Framework
  * AAO: Avatar Optimizer ([Download](https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/))
  * Modular Avatar ([Download](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/))

## What this does and does not
### Does
* Flag non-Rig bone as [`<NoIK>`](https://wiki.resonite.com/Humanoid_Rig_Requirements_for_IK#Ignoring_Bones)
* Rename bones to be [Rig-detector friendly](https://wiki.resonite.com/Humanoid_Rig_Requirements_for_IK#Bone_Requirements)
* Serialize processed avatar as glTF format
* Call VRChat Avatar Build hooks
* Call NDMF plugins

### Does not
* Convert Material: Always exported as Standard Shader. This is technical limitation on UniGLTF. You may import them as XiexeToonShader (or any suitable built-in Shader).
* Convert Animation: Always ignored. You may want to reconstruct them by Protoflux after importing.

    * Invoke VRChat SDK preprocessor: Calls VRChat SDK preprocessor. \

      This option cannot be used when the target does not have "VRC Avatar Descriptor".

* The file ending with `.gltf` - The converted glTF file. \
    The name is determined from your input. For example, Mafuyu will be exported as `Mafuyu.gltf`.
* Backlink-related files. These file will not be created if original hierarchy not a Prefab.
  * `serialized_local_modification.prefab` - Used for backlink. \
      Created if the Prefab instance has yet-saved [overrides](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/PrefabInstanceOverrides.html).
