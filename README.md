# Resonite Import Helper
Bake and Import.

## Requirement and recommended tools
* UniGLTF is required to run. Download it from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases).
* Git is required to install. Download it from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Following tools are optional. This tool can invoke their hooks.
* VRChat Avatar SDK ([Download](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/))
* Non-Destructive Modular Framework
  * AAO: Avatar Optimizer ([Download](https://vpm.anatawa12.com/avatar-optimizer/en/))
  * Modular Avatar ([Download](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/))

## What this does and does not
### Does
* Flag non-Rig bone as [`<NoIK>`](https://wiki.resonite.com/Humanoid_Rig_Requirements_for_IK#Ignoring_Bones)
* Rename bones to be [Rig-detector friendly](https://wiki.resonite.com/Humanoid_Rig_Requirements_for_IK#Bone_Requirements)
* Serialize processed avatar as gLTF format
* Call VRChat Avatar Build hooks
* Call NDMF plugins

### Does not
* Convert Material: Always exported as Standard Shader. This is technical limitation on UniGLTF. You may import them as XiexeToonShader (or any suitable built-in Shader).
* Convert Animation: Always ignored. You may want to reconstruct them by Protoflux after importing.
